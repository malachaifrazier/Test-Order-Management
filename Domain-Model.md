Order Management System
Let's build a very simple order management system having orders from pending up to completed state.

Requirements
An order has a control number and a state.

When the order is added to the system, it has a pending state.

I want to be able to start the progress of an order.

I want to be able to complete an order.

I want to filter orders by number control and state.

Invariants
A pending order can only go to in progress state.

An in progress order can only go to completed.

Completed orders are done and should preserve its state.

Instructions
Create a github repo to develop your solution.

PS 1: Using a css library/framework is a plus.

PS 2: Tests are needed.

PS 3: Weâ€™ll evaluate everything from the git history to the implemented code.

### Let Us Go

# State Management https://github.com/Betterment/steady_state
bundle exec rails g scaffold Order state:string control_number:integer
bin/rake db:migrate

class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include SteadyState

  steady_state :state do
    state 'pending',     default: true
    state 'in_progress', from: 'pending'
    state 'complete',    from: 'in_progress'
  end

  def control_number
  end

  def start
    with_lock { update(state: 'in_progress', from: 'pending') }
  end

  def start!
    with_lock { update!(state: 'in_progress', from: 'pending') }
  end

  def complete
    with_lock { update(state: 'complete', from: 'in_progress') }
  end

  def complete!
    with_lock { update!(state: 'complete', from: 'in_progress') }
  end

end
